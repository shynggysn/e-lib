howSetBody=We, like in a regular library, need registration so that we know exactly which books you are reading and can offer something out of tens of thousands of books that is right for you. After registration, you can immediately start reading any books â€” there is a trial fragment for almost every one so that you can look through and try out a particular book for free before subscribing. Add your favorite books to the reading list, pay for a subscription, and that's it - the books are at your disposal until the end of the paid time. You can read them on the website via a browser, use the iPhone and iPad app or the Android app. Many books from the free set you can read without a subscription, for example, classics and publications that the authors and publishers have allowed to read without payment. There are more than 106,000 of them, so if your subscription has ended and you want to read, pay attention to them or re-read something from the eternal classics.
whereFrom=Where do books come from
whereFromBody=Now we have more than 375,000 books in our collection. Of these, 106,000 are books that can be read for free, it is enough to register. The MyBook catalog now includes the entire collection of publications from the LitRes bookstore, and we are constantly working to ensure that more and more publishers and authors appear in the catalog. Tens of thousands of books are an impressive number, but this is still quite a bit compared to the hundreds of thousands of books that are available only in paper form. If you represent a publishing house that wants to open its books to readers by subscription, or you are an author who wants to get into the library, bypassing the usual publishers - write to us. If you represent the copyright holder and you have any questions about the rights to books and about their distribution through MyBook, ask a question by mail, we will definitely answer.
yourElib=YOUR ELECTRONIC LIBRARY
description=this is a modern library on the Internet that gives you access to a catalog of bestsellers and classical literature, including novelties of various genres: from fiction to popular science books and business literature. More than 376,000 titles from more than twenty different genres.
description2=In the usual sense, e-books have so far been similar to paper ones: they are separate files that need to be downloaded and stored somewhere, then thrown into a reader-reader, and if you have several reading devices, you will have to maintain a separate copy of your library on each. If you do not just read books, but also save quotes and bookmarks, then you most often have to synchronize all this manually.
description3=It is for those who read a lot and with pleasure that we decided to make an E-lib club-library, by joining which you will be able to read not only books that you already have, but also publications from our extensive catalog.
